# Cost Of Living in America
The cost of living in America is remarkably high in many of its cities, especially when compared to the median income of its population. This visualisation takes the cost of housing, groceries, transportation, utilities, health care, and more in cities from across the 50 states and compares them to each other.

For each column, the data is shown in ascending order from top to bottom. This means, a city at the top of a column has a lower cost for that category than one that is at the bottom of the same column. An exception is made for the "relative" column, as it ranks cities from least favourable to most favourable when both the median income and cost of living have been taken into consideration. For every column, each city is represented by a line, where the length of the line indicates the median income of the given city.
